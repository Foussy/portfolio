# Project 1 : pyapod
### Python3 | PyQt5
This little software is a cross platform front-end of the [Atronomy Picture of the day website ](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/astropix.html). Posting Space related photos & videos everyday since June 1995. It is designed with python3 and PyQt5 library and it uses the API developped by NASA.

Main features :
* Loading and rezising dynamically the images from the API. 
* Opens up today’s picture
* Possibility to change the date backward/forward, select a specific or a random one.
* Title, date, description and copyrights displayed of the bottom textbox.
* Dark theme for better aesthetic and consistent with Space theme.

Features in developement :
* Favorites menu
* cache manager to enhance performance when loading and resizing images

I developed this app mainly because I like APOD a lot and I regularly spend some time browsing
cool pictures and reading stuff about Space. It was a good introduction to APIs, how they work, etc...
